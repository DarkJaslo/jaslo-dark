# jaslo-dark

A Visual Studio Code theme with my personal preferences. It is intended to be progressively upgraded whenever I find both new stuff to add and time to do so.

This last part is mainly for me:

1. Open vscode in the repo, hit Run>Start Debugging
2. On the other window, ctrl+shift+P>inspect editor tokens and scopes to see items
3. Do
```sh
vsce package
vsce publish
```
